        text: "Do you only have a couple of days to visit Puerto Viejo? So did we! We only had 1 night coming from Tortuguero and wanted to make the best out of the time we had in this charming beach town located on the southern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. With its laid-back atmosphere, pristine beaches, and lush tropical jungle, Puerto Viejo is the perfect destination for a quick weekend escape. In this article, we'll share our experience of spending two days in Puerto Viejo, and give you tips on how to make the most out of your trip.<br/>    We arrived in Puerto Viejo early on a Saturday morning, excited to start our adventure. Our Airbnb wasn't ready yet, so we decided to rent a quad nearby and head to Punta Uva to soak up some sun. The beach was stunning, with turquoise and calm waters. We took a hike to a rock arch and enjoyed the breathtaking view. For lunch, we stopped by Selvin's, a local Caribbean restaurant, and tried some delicious Caribbean chicken with Rice and Beans.<br/>[https://i.imgur.com/Yqa5kBE.png <br/>    Afterward, we checked into our Airbnb, took a refreshing shower, and rested for a while. For dinner, we decided to try Cafe Viejo, an Italian restaurant located in the center of town. The food was fantastic, we tried the “Fritto Misto”, a mix of fried fish and seafood. Later that night, we headed to Salsa Brava, a beachside bar that's known for its reggae nights and chill vibe.<br/>    The next day, we woke up early to catch a bus to Cahuita National Park, we got coffee and croissants at the Degustibus Bakery. We recommend taking the public bus to Cahuita, as it's a cheap and convenient way to get to the park. We arrived at the entrance of the park by 8 and started walking: we were pleasantly surprised by the number of animals we saw on our hike. We saw monkeys swinging from the trees, sloths sleeping in the branches, and even a family of pizotes with their younglings! The trail was well-kept and flat, making it accessible to all ages and fitness levels. We hiked for a couple of hours, stopping by the beach that’s right next to the path to swim and rest a little.<br/>[Photo of Pizotes??? <br/>    After our hike, we headed back to Puerto Viejo to pack up and check out. We were lucky to leave on a Sunday when there were no big trucks on the road, making our journey back to San José much smoother. <br/>    In conclusion, Puerto Viejo is an excellent destination for a quick weekend getaway. With its stunning beaches, vibrant nightlife, and natural beauty, you'll never run out of things to do.
