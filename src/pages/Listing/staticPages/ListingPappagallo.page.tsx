                            Puerto Viejo is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world, thanks to its stunning surroundings. The town boasts immense beaches that are surrounded by tropical rainforest, as well as two National Parks (Manzanillo and Cahuita). At night, the town comes alive with a lively and active nightlife scene. When you stay here, you'll be able to fully immerse yourself in everything that makes Puerto Viejo unique.
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The house is located close to beach access that eventually leads to Cocles. Along the way, you'll have the opportunity to spot a variety of animals and admire natural pools in the coral. There's even a hidden sightseeing spot waiting to be discovered!
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Getting around in Puerto Viejo and its surroundings is easiest by renting a bike or a scooter. However, there is also a reliable public bus service available that can take you to Cahuita, Manzanillo, and Sixaola. If you prefer to drive, we can accommodate cars as well. We offer private parking but please let us know if you have a larger pickup truck that requires additional space.
